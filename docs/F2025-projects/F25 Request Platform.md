### **Project Description**

The Request Platform is a comprehensive task management system tailored for student design teams. It features a high-performance web interface with a Discord-based authentication gate. The platform allows for real-time task tracking through a Kanban-style board, supporting complex user interactions like drag-and-drop, batch status updates, and a "claim" system for members to pick up tasks instantly.

### **Key Features**

- **Discord Authentication:** Secure login system ensuring only authorized server members can access the platform.
- **Dynamic Kanban Board:** Drag-and-drop columns for task status management.
- **Task Claiming:** Interactive "Claim" button that assigns tasks to the user and moves them to the assigned column.
- **Smart Forms:** Validated "Assign To" dropdowns and "Due Date" checks to prevent past-date entries.
- **Advanced UX:** Transient "Undo Delete" toasts, hover-to-reveal icon labels, and foldable archive sections.
- **Batch Operations:** Capability to modify status and priority for multiple task cards at once.

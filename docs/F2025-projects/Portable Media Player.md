### **Project Description**

Imagine CarPlay and an earbud combined into one—something you can take anywhere and attach onto any of our electric vehicles; that's the Fall 2025 Media Player! This project uses the Bluetooth capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller family to act as a host and pair to headphones. Leveraging the configurable GPIO matrix and firmware peripheral controllers, the team built a custom PCB and firmware applications for streaming audio from a MicroSD card and displaying information on an LCD screen.

### **Key Features**

- Bluetooth host pairing to headphones (ESP32)
- Custom PCB hardware
- MicroSD audio streaming
- LCD display for playback and system information
- ESP32 firmware using GPIO matrix and peripheral controllers

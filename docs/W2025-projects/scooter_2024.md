### Project Description
“Scooty Barnes” is Electrium’s all new Electric Scooter project. It features a CAN bus system for robust communication between electronic components, a custom welded light-weight aluminum deck, and a swing-arm suspension system that facilitates smooth riding. It works with a thumb throttle that engages the hub motor to accelerate the scooter while the disc brakes bring it to a quick stop.

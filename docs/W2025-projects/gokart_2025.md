### Project Info

| **Term:** | Winter 2025 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Lead:**       | Josh Stadnyk |
| **Mechanical Team:** | Ethan Guan, Ivan Lin, Ling-Wei Tang, Grace Pan, Lina, Alena Wang, Mia, Jerry Chen |
| **Firmware Team:** | James, Ally, Jonathan Shanmuganantham, Elin |
| **Electrical Team:** | Emmanuel, Brain Zhang, Andrew Chai |


### Our Goal
We are building Electriums first electric Go-Kart! This project is unique because we are working with two independent electric motors. This allows our team to tackle an array of complexities both mechanically and electronically to expand our knowledge in these respective fields. Currently, the team is making swift progress in getting the car to a driving state, and we hope to hit the road by the end of the term!
 

### Key Features
- Mechanical Systems: Almost everything so far has been designed and manufactured by the team. The chassis is complete, along with the wheel hubs. The current mechanical tasks include brake and pedal mounts, steering wheel, chair, and battery box. We are currently seeking inspiration in what color the car should be so if you have an idea come swing by one of our meetings.
- Electrical Systems: Each motor runs on 2000W and 48V so we need a lot of power! This term, the electrical team is planning on buying a BMS and working on implementing it with the motors and electronic speed controllers (ESC). Two buck converters (48V → 12V and 12V → 5V) are going to be made for voltage control. This is a great opportunity to get some hands-on experience manufacturing hardware if you are trying to learn!
- Firmware Systems: The firmware team has been working with ESP32 microcontrollers mainly for connecting the OLED display on the steering wheel to information from the BMS.

### Project Description
The Remote Control project is a custom, adaptable, and upgraded controller designed to work with all current and future Electrium Mobility projects. Tailored for seamless communication and enhanced functionality, the W25 Custom RC is one of Electrium Mobility’s most versatile and valuable projects. Featuring a custom PCB with Bluetooth, OLED display, and haptic feedback, with the receiver also including CAN support for VESC communication, the Custom RC is highly comprehensive in both its design and features. 

### What We Do
- Custom Circuit Board: Designed with KiCad, the PCB is designed from the ground up, beginning with schematic capture to PCB layout, ensuring that every component is optimized for performance and reliability. Once the design is finalized, the team handles the soldering of components onto the custom PCB.
- Firmware Development: Built around the ESP32-C6, our firmware is built to support a fully integrated Bluetooth communication system, enabling seamless interaction between the remote control and the device. The OLED display and haptic vibration feedback offers real-time feedback, including battery health, current speed, and adjustable settings. Additionally, we’ve implemented advanced features like power-saving modes and customizable control options, with integration of CANBUS for VESC communication.
- Prototyping & Testing: After completing the initial designs, we build prototypes and push numerous firmware updates to fine tune and thoroughly test the remote under real-world conditions. This stage involves extensive debugging, tweaking hardware and firmware as needed, and ensuring that the system performs optimally across a variety of devices and settings.
- User Interface Optimization: To enhance the user experience, we focus on refining the user interface displayed on the OLED screen. We prioritize clear, easily readable information and intuitive navigation of features, ensuring that the remote is not only functional but also user-friendly.


### Our Goal
Our primary goal is to improve the electrical and firmware abilities of our team. For many, it was the first time ever using KiCad, circuit design, and learning the schematic capture and design process. Additionally, we learned soldering, component selection, and footprint design. The team learned about CANBUS and Bluetooth interfacing, as well as how to develop firmware for the remote’s full functionality. This included controlling VESC, programming microcontrollers to respond to user inputs, and managing the OLED display.

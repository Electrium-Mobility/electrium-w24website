### Project Info

| **Term:** | Winter 2025 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Lead:**       | Justin, Harman |
| **Mechanical Team:** | Christian Tetreau, Leek Lee, Athavan Mohanakumar, Mathilda LaBrash-White, Nabil Azab |
| **Electrical/Firmware Team:** |  Leek Lee, Kevin Lee |


### Project Goal
Our team is designing and building a custom electric longtail conversion kit, which aims to convert an older unused/forgotten bike into an electric cargo bike, which can be used as an eco-friendly alternative to cars!


### Mechanical Features
- We will be designing and building a custom frame which will be able to mount to a variety of bikes on the market, which can add cargo space onto a non-cargo bike. CAD and manufacturing will be done by us, as well as FEA of the frame to ensure that it can support the intended loads. 

### Electrical/Firmware Features
- We will be building a custom battery pack and bike computer, both of which will be designed and built in house! The battery pack is a 12s4p pack, which will have both good range and power output. The pack will also be in a non-traditional shape, which will be formed around the frame geometry to keep the bike feeling nimble, even with the added weight. Our motor will be controlled by an ESC, which is like the brain behind the motor. This ESC will be configured through the VESC tool. Additionally, we will be designing a custom bike computer which will have all the telemetry provided from the ESC/Sensors (Sent through UART/I2C/SPI), as well as built-in Google Maps integration.

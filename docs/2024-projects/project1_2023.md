### Project Description

In this project, our team is designing and building an electric skateboard from the ground up. Our goal is to seamlessly integrate mechanical, firmware, and electrical components to create a fully functional and efficient electric skateboard. Some of our team's work includes creating the skateboard deck, spotwelding and soldering our battery as well as integrating firmware into the vehicle to get it running. 

Our project aims not only to successfully create a high-performance electric skateboard but also to foster teamwork and enhance our skills in various technical areas. Through collaboration and hands-on experience, we strive to deepen our understanding of mechanical design, electrical engineering, and firmware development.

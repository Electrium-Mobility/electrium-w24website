### Project Description

Volter is the first electric bike Electrium developed by an experienced team of Engineering students. The bike is fully welded using a previous jig the IDEAs Clinic developed. The tubes were hand-notched with angle grinders, and the battery box is a 3D printed 3-part PLA box with an acylic sheet on top. It features a thumb-throttle and up to 20km of range.
